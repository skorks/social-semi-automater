- download selenium rc sever and get the selenium rc jar
- sudo gem install selenium-client
- need to start up the server before anything: java -jar selenium-server.jar

Bugs/Features
- rake task to build project
- rake task to run project
- pass in location of submissions file on startup or by default, one level below main.rb
- app not shutting down in the end and neither is selenium server, intermittent
- test for invalid account and exit if invalid


DONE
- if already submitted then submit the next one straight away don't wait DONE
- make submissions file pipe delimited instead of comma delimited, so don't need to wrap content in quotes DONE
- if coma in url doesn't work properly FIXED (by making file pipe delimited)
- be able to handle single quotes inside double quotes DONE (no longer relevant since file pipe delimited)
- if currently can't submit then wait 10 minutes then try again DONE
- log what has been done DONE
- log the next sleep time DONE
- rescue any submission error, log it and keep going with other submissions DONE
- rake task to start/stop selenium server DONE
- selenium server should start up and shut down as part of application flow DONE
- fix app to not catch system level exceptions DONE (althoug still catching everything when submitting)
- pass username and pass when starting up the app on the command line (remove real user and pass from codebase)
